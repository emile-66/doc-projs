# How to create and use a Sprint in Jira.

A sprint in Jira is a period of time in which the development team implements and delivers a product increment by completing a set of issues. Sprints are planned on the Backlog screen, making it easy to keep track of progress, prioritization, and scope of each issue. 

## Prerequisites

Before creating a sprint in Jira, ensure you have the following:

- A Jira account.

- A [Jira Scrum project](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/create-a-new-project/).

- Permission to manage sprints within the project.

## Step 1: Create a sprint

1. Within your Scrum project, navigate to the **Backlog** tab.

2. Click **Create sprint**.

## Step 2: Populate sprint 

Once you've created a sprint, you can fill your sprint with issues (also known as tickets) to keep track of the team's progress and to keep the workflow organized.

### Add existing issues to the sprint

If there are issues in the backlog you want to add to the sprint, click and drag the issue from the backlog to be under the desired sprint.

**Warning:** Avoid deleting issues as they cannot be recovered. Instead, mark them as Done.

### Add new issues to the sprint

1. Click **Create issue** under the sprint.

2. From the drop-down menu, specify if this issue is a story, task, or bug. *A story is the most common type of issue and encompasses a single problem.*

3. Name your issue. Press enter to add this issue to the sprint.

4. To learn more about how to edit and configure issues, including adding subtasks, see [Create an issue and subtask](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/create-an-issue-and-a-sub-task/).

### Organize issues under epics

You can also organize your stories to be under epics. *Epics help to group related issues that represent a larger initiative, making it easier to organize projects.*

To learn more about epics, see [Learn how to use epics in Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/tutorials/epics).

## Step 3: Start sprint

1. Click **Start sprint**.
2. In the pop-up window, specify the following details:
    - The name of the sprint.
    - The duration or the start and end dates.

**Warning:** Avoid editing the details of a sprint after starting as it can disrupt tracking and reporting.

## Conclusion

Now you've learned how to create, fill, and start a sprint. This allows you to efficiently manage large projects in your team.
