# How to create and use a Sprint in Jira.

A sprint in Jira is a period of time in which the development team implements and delivers a product increment by completing a set of issues. Sprints are planned on the Backlog screen, making it easy to keep track of progress, prioritization, and scope of each issue. 

## Prerequisities

Before creating a sprint in Jira, ensure you have completed the following:

- Created a Jira account.

- Created a [Jira Scrum project](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/create-a-new-project/).

## Step 1: Create a sprint

1. Within your Scrum project, navigate to the **Backlog** project tab.

2. Click **Create sprint**.

## Step 2: Populate sprint 

Once you've created a sprint, you can fill your sprint with issues (also known as tickets) to keep track of the team's progress and to keep the workflow organized.

### Add existing issues to the sprint

If you there are issues in the backlog you want to add to the sprint, click and drag the issue from the backlog to be under the desired sprint.

**Note that it is not recommended to delete issues as they cannot be recovered. Instead, mark them as Done**.

### Add new issues to the sprint

1. Click **Create issue** under the sprint.

2. From the drop-down menu, specify if this issue is a story, task, or bug. *A story is the most common type of issue and encompasses a single problem.*

3. Name your issue. Press enter to add this issue to the sprint.

4. To learn more about how to edit and configure issues, including adding subtasks, see [Create an issue and subtask](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/create-an-issue-and-a-sub-task/).
    **Note that you can only create subtasks if your adminstrator has enabled this feature.**

5. You can organize your stories to be under [epics](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/tutorials/epics), which may span multiple sprints.

## Step 3: Start sprint

1. Click **Start sprint**.
2. In the pop-up window, specify the name of the sprint. You can also specify the duration or the start and end date.

**It is recommended to not edit the details of a spring after it has started.**

## Conclusion

Now you've learned how to create, fill, and start a sprint. This makes managing large projects in your teams much easier.
